Anant Ambani, who was spotted last night left everybody stunned with his transformation. His grandfather, the legendary Dhirubhai Ambani, would have been proud of him for living up to his belief that nothing is impossible if one focuses on it.
The youngest son of Nita and Mukesh Ambani had made a self-commitment one-and-a-half years ago — to fight a medicine-induced obesity and come out victorious. He has lost a staggering 108 kilos in less than 18 months. As he was determined to lose weight in the most natural and safest way possible, he followed a strict diet and exercised for five-six hours every day.

Nita M Ambani, his mother is most pleased about her son's accomplishment. Having had seen him through this journey, working hard and sweating it out daily for more than 500 days, she is floored by her son's dedication to his own health. The determination and will power that he has shown in fighting and conquering the most daunting challenge is an inspiration for all, including herself, said the proud mother.

As a child, he suffered from chronic asthma and the strong medication led to his weight gain. Doctors had warned that losing weight by natural means would be an uphill task. But he was determined to get fit by his 21st birthday.

An animal lover and wildlife enthusiast, the journey of Anant, who is currently a junior at Brown University in the US, is nothing short of inspirational. It is a reminder that with hard work, dedication and focus, anything is possible.

Just the other day at work, in the women's washroom, a colleague was whining about her tattoo to a friend, and to anyone who cared to listen. Inspired by Priyanka Chopra's body art, she decided to get a small design on the side of her hand. Apparently, the reaction to her body art — at home and at work — wasn't what she had expected. She was now considering laser removal. A reason why they tell you to think before you ink.

Work and tattoos is not a match made in heaven. Maybe because they started as the bastion of the marginalised: gypsies, freak shows, criminals and the non-conformists. A Pew Research Center study found that 76 per cent of respondents feel tattoos and piercings hurt an applicant's chances of being hired during a job interview. And 39 per cent of those surveyed believe employees with tattoos and piercings reflect poorly on their employers.
</p>
<p align="justify">

I ink, therefore I am
But etiquette trainer Sheena Agarwal has noticed some relaxation in corporate attitude towards body art. "While industries like banking, consultancy and finance are still strict about visible body art, in most other companies, I have noticed even HR professionals sporting small, tasteful inks," she says. It's the profile and industry that determines body art. For someone in a creative, marketing or media company, a tattoo is par for the course. Agarwal says, "Its just another mode of self-expression but make sure your tattoo is not offensive."
</p>
<p align="justify">
A study by CareerBuilder found that tattoos are looked at as a sign of immaturity, bad judgment and bad taste by managers. Over 42 per cent of managers polled said their opinion of someone would be lowered by that person's visible body art.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Corporate grooming and soft skills expert Konkana Bakshi agrees. "We form an opinion of a person in the first seven seconds of meeting them. A visible body art always conjures up images of recklessness and lack of credibility," she says.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The Unwritten Code
Globally, companies prefer written down codes dictating what is acceptable. Starbucks requires employees to cover all tattoos and remove certain piercings. Walt Disney World doesn't allow its employees to use bandages to cover tattoos, but they can use makeup. Wal-Mart specifies tattoos 'that are offensive or distractive are to be covered.' Tattoos at the workplace is a visibility issue - no one cares as long as it stays hidden. Wear dark coloured shirts, full sleeves, leave your hair open, or if need be, wear makeup to hide it.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Clearly, body art and boardroom don't mix. But in India, dress codes are more understood than written down. Agarwal says, "Ultimately, they look at your CV not your tattoo." But even then, the best place for a professional to get inked would be the inner upper arm, shoulders, chest or lower back as they stay covered.

             Almost 90% of the 400 families living in Myadar Oni don't have a toilet

The residents are forced to shell out Rs 30-40 every day to answer nature's call

HUBBALLI: The residents of Old Hubballi's Myadar Oni shell out anything between Rs 30 and Rs 40 every day to answer nature's call. Almost 90% of the 400 families living here don't have a toilet and depend on the area's only pay-and-use washroom built by the Slum Board.

The rest 10% are just lucky. Despite the government spending huge money to end open defecation, people here are struggling to pay a steep sum daily to access something as basic as a toilet.
"We go to toilet at least twice a day and pay Rs 5 each time. We are three people in our family and have to keep at least Rs 30 aside for the expense every day," said Mallappa Myadar, a resident of Myadar Oni. He said that the residents are mostly poor and work as labourers. "We have to spend at least Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,200 a month for using toilet. It's a huge burden on us, of which we can't even relieve ourselves."


</p>

 <p align="justify">
"We don't have an option. The only public toilet sees a huge rush in the morning hours because people need to go to work. After the toilet shuts at 9pm, we have to wait till the morning," said another resident Savitramma Sanshi.
Appeals to the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) to sanction funds for construction of individual toilets have fallen on deaf ears, according to the residents. "The government sanctions Rs 12,000 for constructing an individual toilet. We have applied for it two years ago but haven't got any response from the authority concerned," said Shantavva Navalagund.


</p>

Ward no. 43 corporator Bashir Ahmad Gudamaladmitted to the problem faced by the people of Myadar Oni and he has appealed to the HDMC to release funds for constructing toilets. "I've also appealed for a free-of-cost public toilet. But the HDMC has said free of cost toilets cannot be provided. I will now go to the corporation along with residents," he said.
